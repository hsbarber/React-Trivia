      question: 'What year was Travis County established?',
      explanation: `Travis County was established on January 25, 1840, by an act of the Fourth Congress
    of the Republic of Texas, days after the community of Waterloo had been
    renamed Austin and designated the capital city. The county was named after
    William Barret Travis, legendary commander of the Republic of Texas forces
    at the Battle of the Alamo. Travis County was created from Bastrop County,
    one of the original twenty-three counties formed in 1836. The encompassing

      question: 'What was the main agricultural crop in Travis County in the late 19th century until the middle of the 20th century?',
      explanation: `Cotton became the principal field crop in the late 1880s and remained so for more than sixty years.
      The 1890 census reported 65,000 acres—nearly 30 percent of the county's improved farmland—planted in cotton;
      by the turn of the century the amount of land devoted to cotton had increased to 113,300 acres,
      or 56 percent of the improved farmland. However, as more marginal land was used and the soil
      became depleted, production levels fell; in 1930, 143,000 acres produced only 19,000 bales.
      By the late 1950s cotton accounted for only 26 percent of the total cropland harvested,
      and by 1980 it had fallen to only 8 percent.`,
